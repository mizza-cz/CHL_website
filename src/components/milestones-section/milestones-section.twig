        Past and Future Sustainability Milestones
      </h6>
      <p>
        In our effort to becoming a more sustainable and responsible organisation we are continuing
        a journey that has started since the CHL first launched in 2014. Below you can find more
        information on the sustainability milestones we have already hit but also the ones we have
        set out to tackle in the next few months and years. Our aim is to bring more and more of
        these stones to the surface. We have identified specific key areas within the 7 Ps which we
        want to put the biggest emphasis on.
