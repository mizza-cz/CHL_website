								<span>Sustainability = Responsibility</span>
								7 Pillars guiding the way for the CHL sustainability strategy
							</h1>
							<p>
								Sustainability, or the ability to sustain oneself, can have various
								definitions and meanings. It’s a term that has existed for more than
								300 years, rooted in the German forest management of the 18th century.
								And it’s a term that is now coining the strategies of international
								corporations as well as SMEs, major events and entire industries.
							</p>
							<p>
								Sustainability is increasingly relevant for sporting organisations, as
								well. It focuses primarily on economic, social and environmental
								aspects, also referred to as the triple bottom line. For the Champions
								Hockey League (CHL), sustainability can be equated to responsibility.
								An organisation, an event, a federation or in our case a pan-European
								competition bears a certain responsibility for its social impacts, its
								environmental footprint and its economic behaviour. The latter is
								closely connected to the term governance, the way an organisation is
								conducting its business.

								Important steps taken to get on this journey
							</h2>
							<p>
								The truth is: The CHL is a lean organisation with only seven full-time
								employees working at the main office in Zug, Switzerland. We are all
								fully dedicated to making the CHL what it is meant to be: a top-notch
								sporting competition. If we want to make a difference in
								sustainability-related areas, we know we cannot embark on this journey
								alone. That is why we need to bring our clubs, the national leagues,
								our partners, suppliers and other stakeholders along. To do so, we
								decided to initiate the following steps:

											Our team at the CHL office collected any sustainability actions
											they could think of that we as a league were already doing to
											create a first state analysis. This brainstorming provided a
											great starting point and is part of the 7 Pillars analysis
											below. A key task was also to discuss the relevance of the most
											important sustainability-related metrics with the help of an
											external sustainability expert. You can’t manage what you don’t
											measure is usually the way to go. However, in the case of the
											CHL, a lot of traditional sustainability metrics are not
											necessarily applicable (or collectible) due to the nature of the
											competition.

											The various national leagues in Europe and their clubs are the
											backbone of the CHL. They send us their best teams to compete
											for the title of European club champions. But the national
											leagues (through their clubs) are also the ones hosting the
											games. In some cases, these national leagues are already further
											with regards to their sustainability actions. Some already have
											sustainability standards that need to be followed by the clubs
											or sustainability action is even part of the clubs’ licensing
											agreements. Other leagues are merely starting out or don’t have
											sustainability as a focus yet. It was therefore important for us
											to understand what these leagues are already doing, if they had
											a person in charge of sustainability and determine what the best
											way moving forward would be. We sent all our shareholder leagues
											a questionnaire in December 2023 asking for their insights. A
											copy of the questionnaire can be downloaded here.

											Even though sport often refers to its innovative nature, when it
											comes to sustainability it is lagging behind other industries.
											Most ice hockey clubs do not yet have a head of sustainability
											or publish a sustainability report. However, especially large,
											international corporations that invest in professional sport
											often do, and the same can be said for the commercial partners
											of the CHL. Our biggest partners all have sustainability
											roadmaps, targets and put a certain emphasis on social, economic
											and environmental impacts. It was therefore important for us to
											start a conversation with Infront. Infront not only has its own
											sustainability strategy and published its first sustainability
											report in 2023, but it is also in touch with all our current and
											potential partners. As part of a workshop with the Infront team
											we discussed our intentions related to sustainability and it is
											our goal to closely collaborate with Infront on anything related
											to sustainability and our partners. Ideally, in the upcoming
											years we can identify opportunities to collaborate and can offer
											communication platforms for our partners to talk about their
											sustainability projects if they want to.

											As we set out to put more emphasis on sustainability topics in

											our participating clubs very quickly. A sustainability checklist
											that inspires the clubs to be more aware of their impacts and
											become more sustainable. As our conversations with the leagues
											showed, the degree to which sustainability plays a role in these
											clubs’ strategies varies greatly. Some are already actively
											tackling their impacts, while others are yet to define how they
											want to tackle sustainability related areas of their business.

								An important part of a first evaluation of our sustainability impacts was discussing key
								metrics that would help us shed more visibility on areas of improvement. 
							</h2>
							<p>
								If we were a club or an event, these metrics would typically focus on environmental
								metrics such as travel-related CO2 emissions, energy consumption and sources, water usage,
								transportation numbers, waste information or food and beverage statistics. But also
								information regarding our supply chains, gender statistics or health and safety aspects.
							</p>
							<p>
								However, as an international club competition, things look a little differently. Most of
								the above-mentioned metrics would need to be measured by the participating clubs which is
								something that most clubs are not used to doing.
							</p>
							<p>
								Still, it was important for us to identify and communicate some metrics that are directly
								linked to us as an organisation and competition. These are numbers and stats which we want
								to update on a season-by-season basis. They cannot be compared year over year, though
								because the teams participating in the CHL change every season. This makes it very
								difficult to show improvements, as it is like comparing apple to oranges. However, we find
								it important to transparently communicate some of the figures we deem important. The
								identification of these metrics was based on a conversation between the CHL staff, the
								sustainability consultant and Infront, as well as a look around what other sports
								organisations use as their key metrics.
							</p>
							<p>
								Please find some of the baseline stats and numbers for the 2023/24 season we find most
								interesting and relevant to the left. They also included travel and mobility-related
								information.

											One of the most used metrics when it comes to sustainability reporting is
											CO2-emissions. Calculating them is not so easy, though. Primarily because one needs
											to differentiate between the three scopes of emissions according the Greenhouse Gas
											Protocol, the world’s most renowned form of emissions declarations:
										</p>
										<ul>
											<li>
												Scope 1: direct greenhouse (GHG) emissions that occur from sources that are
												controlled or owned by an organization (e.g. emissions associated with fuel
												combustion in boilers, furnaces, vehicles).
											</li>
											<li>
												Scope 2: Scope 2 emissions are indirect GHG emissions associated with the purchase
												of electricity, steam, heat, or cooling. Although scope 2 emissions physically
												occur at the facility where they are generated, they are accounted for in an
												organization’s GHG inventory because they are a result of the organization’s
												energy use.
											</li>
											<li>
												Scope 3: Scope 3 emissions are the result of activities from assets not owned or
												controlled by the reporting organization, but that the organization indirectly
												affects in its value chain (e.g. business travel, employee commutes, waste
												disposal, end-of-life disposal of your products).
											</li>
										</ul>
										<p>
											If you want to learn more about the Greenhouse Protocol and its scopes, please
											visit:
											<a target="_blank" href="https://ghgprotocol.org/">https://ghgprotocol.org/</a>
										</p>
										<p>
											The vast majority of any organization’s emissions stems from scope 3. And the
											biggest source of emissions in sports is typically mobility/traveling where fan
											travel accounts for up to 80% of total emissions. As CHL, there are two major
											sources of mobility-related emissions. The emissions caused by our own team/staff
											when traveling to games, and the emissions caused by the teams (and their fans)
											participating in the competition.
										</p>
										<p>
											Talking about metrics and emissions without mentioning mobility would be largely
											misleading and incomplete. We acknowledge that traveling is accountable for most of
											our emissions. The truth is, organizing an international club competition is only
											possible if there is traveling involved. It’s what makes the Champions Hockey League
											unique in the hockey world. But that doesn’t mean we don’t try to minimize the
											impact we’re having. By using software, we try to optimize our game schedules so
											that the clubs can travel as efficiently as possible. When it comes to staff travel,
											we look at it as a necessary part of the way we work as we are organising or
											delivering our events around Europe. Travel is also important for building and
											maintaining relationships across all stakeholder groups. However, we acknowledge
											that air travel is a critical sustainability priority for the CHL and we need to
											optimise our travel footprint in this regard. As a first step, CHL has therefore
											adapted its travel policy and included environmental considerations (TBC). Where
											reasonable and feasible, alternative means to air travel are considered.

										<h3>Definition</h3>
										<p>
											One of the key UN SDG’s is SDG 17, “Partnerships for the Goals”. Sport plays a vital
											role in bringing people together and inspiring people in a way that many other
											sectors cannot. As is commonly stated, “Sport has the power to change the world”. By
											coming together, in partnership, sport has the chance to use this power, and its
											global voice, to help drive a more sustainable future for sport and the planet.
										</p>

										<h3>CHL Partnerships impact</h3>
										<ul>
											<li>
												<strong>IIHF, Hockey Europe and E.H.C </strong>
												We work closely with the biggest players in European ice hockey, namely, the
												International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF), Hockey Europe, and the Alliance of
												European Hockey Clubs (E.H.C) to further develop European ice hockey.
												Participation in regular meetings and/or general information sharing on different
												subjects (e.g. scheduling, officiating, communication activities, coordination of
												events, etc.) help coordinate the actions of the different organisations and
												enables everyone involved to use synergies whenever possible and needed.
											</li>
											<li>
												<strong>Infront </strong>
												Infront have been a strong partner of the CHL since it’s inauguration in 2014/15.
												First of all, being the media & marketing partner of the competition, they are in
												charge of concluding broadcasting and sponsorship agreements which is a crucial
												part of the competition’s development. Furthermore, Infront supports us with
												various staff and services, such as marketing and digital media support, media
												operations and distribution or venue management
											</li>
											<li>
												<strong>Creating networks between clubs </strong> We encourage and facilitate
												clubs from different countries to get in touch with each other, to create a
												network, to learn from each other in various areas (sports, youth, marketing,
												arena infrastructure etc.). This happens for example via different groups that the
												CHL office sets up and that focus on specific aspects of the competition (e.g.
												management, marketing, communication, sports). These groups meet regularly online
												and/or face-to-face. Thanks to insights into other organisations and valuable
												contacts, clubs are enabled to grow and improve in all areas (e.g. better
												workflows, better offerings, better pre-season games thanks to new contacts at
												other clubs etc.)
											</li>
											<li>
												<strong>Our partners and suppliers </strong> We are proud of the collaborations we
												have with our partners and suppliers. Most of them have been supporting us for
												several years and together we’ve been able to improve the product on and off the
												ice. To meet the high expectations regarding innovations, the we partner up with
												technology start-ups creating a win-win situation for both parties. Infront is an
												important door opener for us in this area.

										<h3>Definition</h3>
										<p>
											UN SDG 3 focuses on “Good Health and Well-Being” one element of which is getting
											people active. One of sport’s greatest assets is encouraging people to get active.
											It can lead the way in encouraging people to participate in some form of sport or
											activity.
										</p>
										<h3>CHL Participation impact</h3>
										<p>
											Our impact in this pillar is rather limited. How are we promoting the game so that
											more people want to actively play hockey? We looked at different ways of engaging
											our fans but this does not directly relate to them playing the sport. One thing that
											we believe supports the growth of the game is the diverse participation field. The
											CHL has committed to not only involving the six Shareholder Leagues, but at least 11
											leagues in total in our pan-European competition. Currently, there are five
											champions from so called Challenger Leagues represented which gives “smaller” hockey
											nations the chance to compete with the best of the continent and to further grow the
											sport.
										</p>
										<p>
											Getting more young people to play ice hockey is an area that we want to put more
											emphasis on in connection with our legacy program.

										<h3>Definition</h3>
										<p>
											UN SDG’s 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 10 focus on People. Sport can play a vital role in
											every aspect of improving social outcomes. Sport can help to reduce poverty, hunger
											and inequality and improve education, diversity, water, sanitation, health and
											well-being.
										</p>
										<h3>CHL people impact</h3>
										<h4>Player and Officials development</h4>
										<ul>
											<li>
												We encourage young player development by allowing limitless roster changes for
												players aged 20 or younger. This provides the opportunity to gain experience in
												highly competitive games on an international level.
											</li>
											<li>
												Referees from participating leagues get the chance to gain valuable experience in
												high-class international games, at home and abroad (starting from the Playoffs).
												Also, we cooperate with the IIHF Referee Exchange Program which offers additional
												referees to develop in CHL games.
											</li>
										</ul>
										<h3>Education</h3>
										<p>
											Since our foundation, we always focused on contribution to education aspects. We do
											this in the following ways
										</p>
										<ul>
											<li>
												Students of the University of Applied Sciences of the Grisons (FHGR) are involved
												in various projects and in the jury of the CHL’s marketing award where they get
												the chance to vote on the submitted club projects (under supervision of their
												professor who is member of the our marketing committee).
											</li>

											<li>
												We support students of various universities with their bachelor and/or master
												thesis.
											</li>
											<li>
												We as an employer support the further education for our staff in various areas
												which allows the people to develop.
											</li>
										</ul>
										<h3>Workplace culture</h3>
										<p>
											We strive for a positive workplace culture and promotes fairness, respect, equality
											and the support of our employees. All staff members can get involved in a wide range
											of subjects and can cooperate across departments. Also, the communication within the
											company is open and transparent and problems are handled pro-actively.
										</p>
										<h3>Charity and community work</h3>
										<p>
											Game Worn Jerseys are sold in our webshop at the end of every season. All earnings
											are donated to charity XX. (Warrior – which charity?). While most of the charity
											work is done through the clubs directly, we have been directly supporting the
											<a href="https//www.championshockeyleague.com/news/help-with-ukrainian-hockey-dreams">Ukrainian Hockey Dream foundation.</a>

										<h3>Definition</h3>
										<p>
											UN SDG’s 13, 14 and 15 focus on the planet. Sport can help the fight against climate
											change, reduce carbon emissions and plastic waste, improve air and water quality and
											help our oceans and “Life on Land”.
										</p>
										<h3>CHL Planet impact</h3>
										<h4>Transportation/mobility</h4>
										<ul>
											<li>
												<strong>Club Travel </strong> With the help of the ligalytics software, we factor
												various parameters in during the scheduling process for the Regular Season,
												focusing on creating round trips & double home games for the first two weekends
												(which limits the amount of flights per team) and ideal routes.
											</li>
											<li>
												<strong>Game Officials travel </strong> During the Regular Season (72 of 101
												games) only domestic game officials are assigned for economic and environmental
												reasons. Foreign head referees are assigned starting with the play-offs. Also,
												whenever possible, game officials are assigned from a city/town where they can
												reach the game by car instead of taking a plane.
											</li>
											<li>
												<strong> Club representatives travel </strong> Whenever possible, we connect our
												flagship events to the ones of our partners (e.g. the CHL Draw takes place at the
												IIHF Ice Hockey World Championship or our General Assembly is linked to the Award
												Night and the General Assembly of the E.H.C. Alliance). By doing so, club
												representatives must only travel once to a destination, which increases
												efficiency, reduces costs and benefits the environment.
											</li>
										</ul>
										<h4>Equipment</h4>
										<ul>
											<li>
												<strong> Strong collaboration with Warrior </strong> Warrior is our central player
												kit supplier since the inauguration of the CHL in 2014. They namely provide player
												and game official jerseys, pant shells and socks. Also, the official fan jerseys
												are produced and distributed by Warrior in the CHL Shop. Together with Infront, we
												join forces with the German Warrior team to make sure the equipment is used as
												efficiently and as sustainably as possible.
											</li>
										</ul>
										<ol>
											<li>All Warrior jerseys are produced in Czechia.</li>
											<li>
												At the end of the season a full set of player jerseys remains with the clubs and
												can be used for non-commercial purposes (e.g. auction for youth program or
												charity), while the other one and both Top Scorer jerseys are returned to
												CHL/Infront.
											</li>
											<li>
												Some of the returned jerseys are then sold for charity, some are distributed to
												partners and others remain with the CHL to be used for a potential Hockey Hall of
												Fame project, prices for fan activations, and, in the future, potentially, also
												for a legacy program.. For the remaining jerseys we are in the process of creating
												a legacy program. The clubs may use the remaining uniform elements such as socks
												and pant-shells for non-commercial reasons (charities, youth teams, gifts, etc.)
											</li>
											<li>
												Starting from the 2024/25 season, participating teams in CHL games will no longer
												receive centrally provided Warrior gloves. From a sustainability point of view,
												this operational move reduces the environmental footprint by minimising shipments
												and facilitating the use of already existing equipment.
											</li>
										</ol>
										<a href="https://www.shop-chl.com/" target="_blank" class="btn btn-arrow mt-32">CHL Shop <svg width="8" height="13" viewBox="0 0 8 13" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">

											</svg></a>
										<h3>Venue management</h3>
										<ul>
											<li>
												Rink board advertisement, press backdrops and player/penalty bench back walls are
												already partially locally produced (Infront has the numbers), which reduces
												shipment needs. Under ice branding is only implemented for the Playoff games (29
												out of 101), which reduces the energy and water consumption at the venues. Game
												promotion materials (posters, leaflets etc.) are all produced locally. We use LEDs
												for advertisement wherever stadium infrastructure allows.
											</li>
											<li>
												As opposed to other international club competitions, the CHL Final takes place at
												the home venue of one of the finalists which results in no or only short travel
												for most of the attending fans. Furthermore, the existing venue infrastructure can
												be used. If temporary infrastructure is needed, it is sourced from local
												providers. The know-how of the hosts results in best-possible use of the existing
												infrastructure.
											</li>
											<li>
												Infront employees of various departments become involved as Venue Managers (VMs)
												for the CHL to ensure smooth game operations. VMs are assigned locally whenever
												possible and are responsible for various tasks, including coordination with CHL
												and club representatives, sponsors, as well as ensuring compliance with
												contractual agreements. In 2023/24, out of 101 games, only two VMs had to cross a
												national border. The VM program not only benefits the CHL and Infront but also
												allows employees to develop new skills and gain event experience.

										<h3>Definition</h3>
										<p>
											UN SDG 16 focuses on “Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions” which is frequently
											presented as Governance or Power. Sport can lead the way in pushing for world peace,
											reducing conflicts and promoting good governance.
										</p>
										<h3>CHL Power impact</h3>
										<ul>
											<li>
												<strong> Fair Game </strong> Our competition fully complies with existing national
												(NADA) and international (WADA) anti-doping practices; random anti-doping tests
												can occur at any CHL game. We undertake measures to avoid match-fixing and monitor
												all our games on pre-match and live betting integrity together with Sportradar
												Integrity Services.
											</li>
											<li>
												<strong>Independent statutory examination and financial transparency </strong> Our
												finances are examined by independent statutory auditors every year. We communicate
												the finances openly and transparently towards our shareholders and the
												participating teams. Also, the prize money model is publicly shared. We take our
												responsibility towards our shareholders seriously and act as a non-profit oriented
												organisation.
											</li>
											<li>
												<strong>Minimizing marketing resources used by clubs </strong> We provide
												participating clubs with a large amount of templates and ready-to-use content
												(photos, graphics, videos) which can be used to promote the CHL games with
												relatively low local efforts necessary. This helps the teams focus on their
												day-to-day jobs and the marketability of their CHL games
											</li>
											<li>
												<strong>Code of Ethics, Code of Conduct </strong> We follow a strict code of
												ethics and a code of conduct. An anti-discrimination and anti-racism policy is in
												place. More information on these can be found here.
											</li>

										<h3>Definition</h3>
										<p>
											An area not really covered by the UN SDG’s but an area that is a key pillar of sport
											is Profile. Sport helps to promote cities, countries and brands all over the world.
											With access to over half of the world’s population, sport can use its global
											platform to help promote sustainability and deliver a better future for the planet.
										</p>
										<h3>CHL Profile impact</h3>
										<ul>
											<li>
												<strong> Broadening the reach and visibility of participating teams  </strong>By
												participating in the CHL our teams get international exposure. Some of our clubs
												are finding it difficult to further grow their brands in their domestic markets.
												By competing in an international competition the clubs and their sponsors can grow
												their brands. To further strengthen this aspect CHL has given participating clubs
												more commercial rights. Local partners can now be featured as part of the CHL
												outfit and on-ice-branding stays on for the international competition throughout
												the qualifying rounds.
											</li>
											<li>
												<strong> Broadcasting enabling global visibility </strong> CHL games are
												broadcasted to 47 countries by 19 broadcasting partners and/or digital platforms
												worldwide. Our best-on-best competition helps the growth of hockey in Europe and
												globally.
											</li>
											<li>
												<strong> Diverse and international social media following </strong> Our website
												and app saw 855,000 visitors in 2023/24. 297,000+ followers on Social Media and
												more than 21,000 newsletter subscribers help both with the visibility and
												engagement.
											</li>
											<li>
												<strong> Collaboration with a sustainability advisor </strong>·The CHL has decided
												to work with an external sustainability advisor
											</li>
											<li>
												<strong>Using the GSS partnership to create more awareness for sustainability </strong> Starting with the 2024/2025 season we will ask all participating clubs to fill
												out the
												<a href="https://www.globalsustainablesport.com/global-survey/">GSS survey</a>.
												This will help us get a better overview of what the clubs are doing around
												sustainability and by doing this every year we will be better to report on
												progress made on a European-wide level.

										<h3>Definition</h3>
										<p>
											The UN SDG’s 7, 8, 9, 11 and 12 focus on economic activity like clean energy, decent
											work and growth, industry, innovation, infrastructure, sustainable cities and
											communities and responsible consumption and production. Sport can lead the way in
											driving better economic outcomes through sport and also promoting other elements of
											economic activity like sustainable tourism and travel.
										</p>
										<p>
											This is a pillar which is quite hard to connect to the CHL when you take the
											definition above. Again these are mostly areas which only the clubs have direct
											influence over. Our focus is on the economic sustainability, making sure that
											participating in the competition results in a better economic performance of the
											clubs.
										</p>
										<h3>CHL prosperity impact</h3>
										<ul>
											<li>
												<strong> Fair prize money & compensation model </strong>Focus is on paying as much
												prize money as possible to each participating team to contribute to their
												expenses. Also, clubs are entitled to keep all the gate revenue (ticketing, F&B)
												and all revenues generated from the club’s marketing rights in the CHL
												competition. Over the past few years we have continuously given the clubs more
												freedom to market their CHL campaigns with additional rights. Our role is to
												communicate the advantages this has and to provide the clubs with all the tools
												they have to maximize their financial returns.
											</li>
											<li>
												<strong> Optimizing the participating club’s travel </strong> With the help of
												software, we factor various parameters in during the scheduling process for the
												Regular Season, focusing on creating round trips & double home games for the first
												two weekends (which limits the number of flights per team and helps reduce travel
												costs). This has also resulted in fans planning trips to attend two away games as
												part of a roadtrip saving on flight emissions. They fly from A to B to C to A
												instead of A to B to A to C to A, which ultimately promotes a more sustainable
												tourism and travel.

								The importance of Digitalization

							<p>
								Since its inauguration in 2014, the Champions Hockey League has always put a lot of
								emphasis on digitalisation. While the sport itself is a hard-nosed, man-on-man,
								action-loaded activity and very much analog, the aim off the ice has always been to set
								benchmarks regarding the digital aspects of the game.
							</p>
							<p>
								While showcasing technological innovation and reaching and engaging with a
								younger-than-average audience was at the forefront of this strategy, in retrospect it has
								also had a major impact on some sustainability aspects, as these examples below show. They
								primarily refer to less travel and less paper usage in and around the competition:

										<h3>Making the best, not the easiest choices.</h3>
										<p>
											We understand that the CHL has a responsibility in all three areas. And we are
											committed to taking that responsibility and doing everything in our power to be an
											industry leader, even though the circumstances may not make it an easy task. The CHL
											is an international sports competition. One whose unique value proposition also lies
											in the fact that teams from different countries and cultures travel and compete. One
											whose aim is to mobilise and entertain as many people as possible and one that does
											not per se exist to make this world a safer, cleaner or more equal place. But that
											doesn’t mean we can’t look at everything we do and consider the options we have to
											improve our doing and also, use our public awareness to create an impact. In the
											end, being sustainable, being responsible is also about making the most responsible
											choices.
										</p>

										<h3>A transparent framework</h3>

										<p>
											On this website, we would like to be transparent about the choices we have made in
											the past, about the choices we are currently making and about the choices we look
											forward to making in the future.
										</p>
										<p>
											Transparency requires an easy-to-understand framework that helps our clubs, fans,
											business partners and other stakeholders comprehend what it is we are doing at the
											CHL with regards to sustainability. We want to inform but also inspire because we
											know that for us as a pan-European club competition our scope is only limited. It is
											the teams that compete in our competition and it’s the national leagues that send
											those teams to compete. They are the key to making this a successful journey.
										</p>

										<p>
											Up until today there hasn’t been a standard framework for guiding or expressing the
											sustainable activities of a sports organisation. The
											<a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals">UN Sustainable Development Goals </a> are to a
											certain degree also used in sports, but the fact that they were initially developed
											by countries for countries cannot be denied. The more financially driven
											ESG-approach is also one that can be found in sports, but we think it is not
											accurate enough in our case.
										</p>
										<p>
											However, without a clear framework to express our activities it is difficult to show
											the true social, economic, and environmental impact we have on society and
											the planet, whether positive or negative.
										</p>
										<h3>Introducing the 7 Pillars of Sustainable Sport</h3>
										<p>
											That is why we are excited to be one of the first organisations to work with the
											Global Sustainable Sport’s (GSS) 7 Sustainable Pillars of Sport framework. Global
											Sustainable Sport has worked with a variety of academics and stakeholders to produce
											a standard framework and a standard approach to express the sustainable
											activities of a sports organisation.
										</p>
										<p>
											Based on existing frameworks and in-depth research and analysis, the seven
											pillars cover the full spectrum of sport referencing the UN SDGs, as well, yet
											clustering them in a way that is more appropriately suited for sports organisations:
										</p>

										<div class="article__content-img">
											<img src="images/content/readMore.jpeg" loading="lazy" alt="photo" />
										</div>
										<p>
											It is important to mention that the framework was developed for different players in
											sport, e.g. clubs, federations, leagues or events. So not all pillars work the same
											way or are equally important for each player. Take Participation for example. A mass
											participation event engaging thousands of people to be physically active is hard to
											compare to a best-on-best competition where most participants are sitting in the
											stands merely watching. We have taken this fact into consideration, and more
											information on each pillar can be found below.
										</p>
										<h3>A word on digitalisation</h3>
										<p>
											A special segment on this website has been dedicated to the aspect of
											digitalisation. Since we started in 2014/15, we have tried to be at the forefront of
											what’s possible in the digital sports landscape. Whether it is our official website,
											our social media channels, game statistics, the CHL App or the way how we
											communicate and collaborate with the participating teams; being a young and dynamic
											league paved the way for some ground-breaking digital innovations. At the same time
											this digital footprint has been a key element of our sustainability actions. By
											leveraging the advantages of a digital-first approach in terms of how the games are
											conducted, how the communication within the league works and how we interact with
											fans, there have been a number of advantages which we want to outline further down
											below.
										</p>
										<p>
											The CHL has always run on a very lean organisational structure. Collaboration and
											strong partnerships based on professional relationships have made us what we are
											today. Our approach towards responsibility should reflect this. With our limited
											human and financial resources, we would like to tackle our impacts in an effective
											and efficient way, meaning that we want to do the right things and we want to do
											things right.
										</p>
										<p>
											That being said, we just want you to know that we welcome any feedback or
											suggestions on what we can still do better.
